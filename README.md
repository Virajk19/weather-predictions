# Weather Prediction ML Project

## 📦 Project Overview

This project aims to predict various weather features such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, winter) using a machine learning model. The objective is to utilize historical weather data to train the model and deploy it for real-time predictions.
